Paper 1: "Software for Computing and Annotating Genomic Ranges"

Inhalt: 
The main topic of this paper is the description of Bioconductor infrastructure with the focus on DNA annotation. 
In general, it emphasized the importance of ranges on the genome in manipulating gene model annotations, 
as well as on read alignments, detecting overlaps and calculating coverage vectors. Furthermore, different data structures are
examined supporting crucial functions such as the representation of metadata storage and of hierarchical structures among others.  

Paper 2: "A Pipeline for Insertion Sequence Detection and Study for Bacterial Genome"

Inhalt:
The authors of this paper have developed a new design for detecting and classifying insertion sequences (ISs) using a pipeline which
improves on some of the current annotation methods in the aspects of overlapping and consensus problems.
This task was achieved by implementing tools such as OASIS and ISFinder. This new pipeline method was then applied on a set of
23 complete genomes of a bacterial species and some important conclusions were derived from this test based on the IS families
and groups.
