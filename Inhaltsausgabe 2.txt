Paper 3: "Impact of annotation error in a-globin genes on molecular diagnosis."

Inhalt: 
In this paper, the authors examine the discrepancy between the varying identification results of the alpha-globin gene 
derived from different analysis tools (Variobox, MAFFT and Mutation Surveyor) and thus encourages that they are used with 
a certain amount of caution.


Paper 4: "An optimized approach for annotation of large eukaryotic genomic sequences using genetic algorithm"

Inhalt:

This paper is addressing the issue with the computational complexity of DNA annotation and therefore introducing
the Gene Prediction with Genetic Algorithm (GPGA), which offers an improvement of genetic prediction
computations by providing methods where the search is applied on each exon individually. This algorithm was used
on both human and mouse genetic material and proved to be more accurate than other techniques.  

Paper 5: "Annotation and Presentation Systems for Arabidopsis Genome Sequencing Project at Kazusa DNA Research Institute"

Inhalt:
The focus of this paper is on the genome of the plant species Ambidopsis thaliana. Its sequencing and annotation took place
at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute in Japan. This was achieved with the help of the BLAST2 program and the GenBank database among
other tools. As a result, a website KAOS (Kazusa Arabidopsis data Opening Site) was developed with the purpose of providing
free access to the sequenced data.
