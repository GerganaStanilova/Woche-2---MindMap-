DNA annotation

The process of finding and identifying genes in a genome.
To a large extent, it uses the computational power of sequencing algorithms and analysis tools as well as 
biological databases to achieve these tasks. 
DNA annotation can be structural, when it is relating to genomic elements such as ORFs, coding regions and regulary motifs,
or funtional, when it determines the function of the genomic elements.
